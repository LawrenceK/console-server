This is a console server. It can connect to 1 or more serial ports and make these available over SSH.
The data to and from the serial port can be logged to local disk. There is also a cli interface
that can be used to reconfigure the serial ports.

The reason for writing this is the off the self solutions, Cyclades etc., are not cheap, a similar 
solution can be acheived using a raspberry pi and readily available usb to serial adaptors.
e.g. this 16 port one for under Â£200

Authentication
--------------
Version 0.2 and later uses unix password file and users authorised keys for 
logon therefore the console server has to run as root to get access to the relevant files.

Issues with USB hot plug
------------------------
On ubuntu modem-manager is run against all serial ports to probe for it being a modem, 
this interferes with the monitored console collection. You may want to add a blacklist udev
rule to prevent this. 99-usb-blacklist.rules is a sample rule file and goes into /etc/udev/rules.d

Group membership
----------------
By default serial devices belong to the dialout group so the user running the console server needs to 
be a member of this group or to run as root.

CLI Interface
-------------
There is a CLI interface accessible over SSH that can be used to reconfigure the server and serial ports,
as of version 0.3 this can only be accessed by users belonging to the root or sudo groups - i.e. they
have admin rights on the server. This by default is on port 8022 so ssh -p <username>@<address>.

File locations
--------------
Config File:
The system will create a default config file in /etc/consoleserver called config.ini this will be created
to access serial ports ttyUSB0..ttyUSB31. The default management port is 8022 and the default serial ports are on 8023..8054. 
LogFiles:
The default entries are setup to create logfiles in /var/log/consoleserver. If installed
with pip install consoleserver then a logrotate file will be installed to rotate these files daily.

Unit Tests
----------
Most of the code is unit tested.
