This is a console server. It can connect to 1 or more serial ports and make these available over SSH.
The data to and from the serial port will be logged to local disk. There is also a cli interface
that can be used to reconfigure the serial ports.

The reason for writing this is the off the self solutions, Cyclades etc., are not cheap, a similar 
solution can be acheived using a raspberry pi and readily available usb to serial adaptors.
e.g. this 16 port one for under Â£200
